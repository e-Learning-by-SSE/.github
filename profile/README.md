## Hi there 👋

In the near future you'll find an overview of the infrastructure here. 

## Repository Naming Scheme
If you're a developer and want to create a repository here, please use the following repository naming scheme:

`<projectprefix>-<projectname>-<type>`

| prefix in use  | description                                                                                     |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| infrastructure | Cross Cutting Concerns like authentication and infrastructure service like application gateways |
|                |                                                                                                 |
|                |                                                                                                 |
